            <h3>The purpose of the Webpage</h3>
            <p>The primary aim behind creating this webpage is to enhance my coding skills and proficiency. Contemplating how best to achieve this goal, I settled on the idea of developing a website that would be both enjoyable and educational. While considering various options, I realized my passion for books and shows. Hence, I decided to create a platform revolving around literature and entertainment, as I am an avid reader and enthusiast of visual storytelling.</p>
            <h3>How to use this website</h3>
            <p>On the right-hand corner, you will see a selection button. Clicking on it will open a menu where you can choose between show recommendations, book suggestions, or leaving comments with your own recommendations for shows or books you'd like us to explore. Alternatively, you can simply click on the menu option located under the blue line, which will directly take you to the menu available in the upper right corner, providing an easy and convenient way to access the menu options.</p>
